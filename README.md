## Disclaimer

<i> I am a rookie in programming and I am learning from scratch. Many people are involved in teaching me and the programs written here are not necessarily the best way to implement. There can be shorter methods which can save lines of code, but since I am just in the beginning stage of learning any programming language I prefer to do it the longer way. 

If you wish to correct my code or give me better ways to shorten the code you can always contact me on bangalorerohan@gmail.com or Telegram me (@aarzie). Thanks.</i>
