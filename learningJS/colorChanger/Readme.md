## Synopsis

Basic webpage to learn the fundamentals of Javascript, specially about addEventListener and its behaviour, manipulating DOM to change properties of elements and functions in JS.

## What does this do?

The webpage has 6 square blocks which inherits colors from an array (for now). The heading on the webpage displays a random color from the array and one must select the color based on the RGB value displayed. If the selected color matches the displayed color, then all the squares change their color to the selected one. Else, the wrongly selected square disappears.

## What next?

 By improving the HTML and CSS, I wish to make the webapp more presentable. 3 different playing modes will be added : Easy, Medium and Hard.

## What is implemented?

* Random picking of an element from colors list to be selected color
* Loading of random colors into color array
